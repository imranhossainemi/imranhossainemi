### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Imran Hossain
#### I am Full stack Developer
 I'm a full-stack software engineer with expertise in Javascript, PHP, and Laravel. I specialise in developing software solutions for small businesses.
 I have extensive experience working remotely and collaboratively through my training at Microverse, an online software school. This has taught me important skills such as communication, teamwork, and meeting tight deadlines, which are crucial in any development role.

In addition, my software engineering degree has provided me with a solid foundation in coding, documentation, and following requirements, allowing me to learn new languages and technologies quickly. I am also committed to continuous learning and practice and have already completed several projects like awesome books, capstone project, personal portfolio in CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.

My previous experience as an online freelancer for 2 years has honed my time management and deadline management skills, which I apply every day in my work as a software engineer.


Skills: VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / PHP
